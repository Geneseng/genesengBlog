## No AutoML Left Behind

The `NALB` package has been designed to provide an R interface to Python autoML libraries. `NALB` runs on top of the `reticulate` package making a "bridge" between Python and R.

## System requirements

## Installation

You can install the development version of NALB using:

``` r
devtools::install_github("geneseng/NALB")
```
