## INTRODUCTION

<p color="#64677F"> At Geneseng, we are used to creating new features to improve our AI-driven platform. To deploy them quickly in the cloud, we use a technology called Docker. </p>

<p color="#64677F"> Docker is a “container based platform” running applications in container environment. With a simplest architecture, Docker provides a modern, faster, flexible and reproducible way to deploy app or ML models in any infrastructure such as computer or cloud server. </p>


## HOW IT WORKS

### ARCHITECTURE

<a href=#><img src='https://geneseng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/virtual_machines_vs_containers.jpg'></a>

<p align="center" color="#64677F"> Virtual Machine vs Container architectures </p>

<p color="#64677F"> Virtual Machines and Containers have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits but work differently. </p>

<p color="#64677F"> Virtual Machine (VM) is a virtual computer that works exactly like a physical computer. Hardware components (RAM, hard disk, CPU, pilots …) are emulated by a software called a hypervisor. To run, a portion of the host computer’s resources must be allocated to the VM. Using a VM is like running a computer inside a computer. </p>

<p color="#64677F"> “Container based platform” like Docker embeds only necessary programs to deliver app in a container. Container embed fewer resources than VM by emulating only the Operating System (OS: the Linux kernel). That why, containers allow *FASTER* and *PORTABLE* deployment. Besides to make *REPRODUCIBLE* deployment, all instructions are written in a simple text file called Dockerfile. </p>

### CENTRAL DOGMA

<p align="center" color="#64677F"> Docker pipeline </p>

<p color="#64677F"> The *Dockerfile* works like a cooking recipe. It gathers all necessary instructions to build the desirable program. Docker builds a Docker image automatically by reading the instructions from the Dockerfile. </p>

<p color="#64677F"> A *Docker image* is a read-only template used to create the Docker container. It is composed of several layers packaging all the dependencies, libraries, and code for an operational container environment. </p>

<p color="#64677F"> A *Docker container* is a Docker image instance running in a Docker container. </p>

<p color="#64677F"> All information can be retrieved at https://docs.docker.com/. </p>

<p color="#64677F"> An example of deployment can be found in our <a href= "https://github.com/Geneseng/genesengBlog/inst/Make_ML_models_in_production_with_Docker/Supp"> GitHub repository </a>. </p>

## CONCLUSION

<p color="#64677F"> Docker was designed as a modern way for app deployment. Based on container architecture and a simple dogma, Docker used only necessary resources to make faster, flexible, portable and reproducible deployment than Virtual Machines. </p>

<p color="#64677F"> Nowadays, Docker is become the corner stone of many IT pratices like <a href = "https://geneseng.com/introduction_to_devops_methodology/"> devOps </a> or MLOps allowing continuous integration and deployment. An ecosystem has emerged around Docker and composed of numerous tools including Kubernetes; a famous container orchestration system. </p>
